# Adam Jackman's Keymap for Redox Wireless

- Home rows can be held down for modifier keys
- Layer shifts are on the thumb clusters.
- CAPSLOCK as F19 for hammerspon hyper


The keymap is made up of five primary layers:

- Base QUERTY layer
- Symbols can be accessed via the outer thumb cluster key or toggled via the key next to `T`
- Mouse & Media can be toggled via the key next to `Y`
- Arrows can be accessed via the inner thumb cluster, which activate `WASD` arrows on that side and modifiers on the opposite.
